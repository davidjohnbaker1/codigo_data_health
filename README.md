## TODOs

* [ ] Design concept maps for each hour lesson

## Draft Lesson Ordering (1 per hour)

1. Introduction  
    - Motivation: why learn tidy? 
    - Identification: See tidy vs untidy 
    - Benefits: save huge amount of time later, collaboraiton 
2. Definitions of Data 
    - variable
    - observation 
    - collective unit
    - up to data engineer to think about these things 
3. Definitions of Tidy Data 
    - present two similar same data
    - identify variable
    - Identify observation 
    - identify collective units 
4. Identifying Tidy Data
    - Progressively more difficult examples to SEE
5. Changing Pre-Existing Data
    - Make easy example tidy 
    - Make medium example tidy 
    - make hard example tidy 
6. More Caveats 
    - column name conventions 
7. Long vs Wide Data
    - human vs computer interactions 
8. Summerise and Future Directions
    - review: tidy data 
    - joins 

## Learning Objectives

After completing this course, the learning know will that...

* [ ] setting up your data in a tidy format is the gold standard when it comes to data organization.
* [ ] tidy data has a specific definition of one variable per column, one observation per row, one type of data per table. 
* [ ] setting up your data in a tidy format will allow it to be used much easier across time and space. 
* [ ] a varible is defined as ...
* [ ] an observation is defined as ...
* [ ] a collective unit is defined as ...
* [ ] only one varible goes into every column.
* [ ] only one observation goes into every row. 
* [ ] only one type of data goes into every table. 
* [ ] following these rules allow you to re-structure almost any type of data.
* [ ] column names should be both human and computer readable (snake_case or camelCase) 
* [ ] there exist two general ways of storing data in a tidy way (long and wide) 
* [ ] Wide data is easy for humans to read
* [ ] Long data is easy for computers to read 
* [ ] Software can change wide to long to wide data
* [ ] tidy data is the foundation of learning how to set up a data base
* [ ] tidy data is the foundation for learning joins (SQL) 

After completing this course, the learner will be able to ....

* [ ] identify if data is or is not in the tidy format.
* [ ] give a formal definiton of tidy data. 
* [ ] reformat a non-tidy dataset into a tidy one. 
* [ ] use column name formatting that will minimize problems 
* [ ] identify the difference between wide and long data
* [ ] take a heap of unstructured data and put it into a tidy format. 

## Background

### Learner Persona

#### General Background 

Jorge just started a new job in a marketing department of start up.
He feels comfortable working with the typical suite of software (docs, sheets, slides) required of office work, though everything he learned he just picked up himself.
At his new start-up, he has been assigned to start working with the data team. 
Though he feels very comfortable talking about the types of problems their company solves, he has never had to work with data so much.  

#### Relevant Experience

Jorge consideres himself a very compotent spreadsheet user and knows a lot about his domain area.
He taught himself a lot of what he knows and is proud of that.
That said, he took a bit of offense when some of the data team told him that he shouldn't be seting up is sheets like that as the company migrates to using a bigger database. 

#### Percieved Needs

Jorge has both short term and long term goals when it comes to his learning.
In the short term, he wants to make life as easy as possible his data colleagues.
In the long term, Jorge wants to be able to re-train to work as a data engineer.
In order to complete his long term goals, he needs the data team to see that he is self motivated and willing to learn on his own. 

#### Special Considerations 

Jorge is very busy between his new job and his four year old son.
He needs to be helpful to his team now and will learn about the big picture stuff when he re-trains as a data engineer.

## Common Misconceptions 

- That 'tidy' data is not just looking nice 
- 'Tidy' data has specific definitions 
- tempted to embed multiple observations of an individual in single cell (over input) 
- tempted to put date all as separate columns
- tempted to put bad characters in column names (spaces, non case) 
- use of colors
- variable names as
